## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
library(mapdata)
california<-map_data("state",region='CA')
load('C:\\Users\\gog90\\Downloads\\wind_turbines.rda')
wind_ca <- wind_turbines[wind_turbines$t_state == 'CA',] 
ggplot(california,aes(long, lat)) +geom_polygon() +
geom_point(wind_ca, mapping = aes(xlong, ylat),inherit.aes = FALSE )


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
